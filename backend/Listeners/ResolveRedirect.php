/**
 * The 404 seam: send the visitor somewhere, or write down that we could not.
 *
 * This is the whole plugin as far as a visitor is concerned. Everything else — the screens,
 * the charts, the import — exists to decide what this class does.
 *
 * **Not `ShouldQueue`.** Core's listeners defer because they send email, which is slow and may
 * fail. This one has to answer *this* request: the event carries the response, so deferring it
 * would mean the visitor gets a 404 and the redirect is decided some time afterwards, for
 * nobody. It must also stay cheap, which is why the ordinary case is one indexed lookup.
 *
 * **Nothing propagates.** Core dispatches quietly, so a throw here is swallowed and logged
 * rather than shown — which means an unhandled failure would silently stop every redirect on
 * the site with no symptom but a log line. So failures are caught and named here instead.
